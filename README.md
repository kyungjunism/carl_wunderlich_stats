Carl Wunderlich Null Hypothesis Tests

## What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
## Background:

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 ∘C or 98.6 ∘F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?
<br>
## Exercises:
<br>
In this exercise, we will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.
<br>
1.** Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?**
<br>
Although this is not a requirement for CLT to hold (read CLT carefully), it gives us some peace of mind that the population may also be normally distributed if we assume that this sample is representative of the population. 
<br>
2.** Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?**
<br>
Remember that this is a condition for the CLT, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply. 
<br>
3. **Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?**
<br>
Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why? In this situation, is it appropriate to use the tt or zz statistic?
<br>
4. **Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why? **
<br>
Draw a small sample of size 10 from the data and repeat both tests.
<br>
5. **Which one is the correct one to use?**
 <br>  
What do you notice? What does this tell you about the difference in application of the t and z statistic? 
<br>
6. **At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?**
<br>    
7. **Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?**
<br>
What test did you use and why?
